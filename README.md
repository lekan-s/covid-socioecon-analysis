Socio-Economic Determinants of COVID-19 Mortality: Insights from Census and Pandemic Data Integration
This project integrates census and pandemic data to investigate the socioeconomic factors that contribute to COVID-19 mortality. The study uses sophisticated statistical methods, such as multiple regression modeling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to identify important household, economic, and demographic characteristics linked to regional differences in COVID-19 mortality rates. Important factors are examined for their effects on pandemic outcomes, including household size and age group distributions. With three to five principal components accounting for more than 80% of the dataset's variance, the PCA shows a notable decrease in dimensionality. Scree plots and scatter plots are two examples of visualizations that offer useful information on the connections between mortality rates and explanatory factors. This study provides a framework for policymakers to prioritize measures aimed at the most vulnerable groups during public health emergencies.
